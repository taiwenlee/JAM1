Everything was in place, my prices for almost all of the items I had today were on display so I stood patiently in my stand for some eager customers to come by. Though instead of one or two people approaching, it came to me as a surprise when I saw a large group approach my shop. 

Upon further inspection I had a sneaking suspicion that they weren’t the most friendly of faces around here. A couple of them carried horrid weapons upon their backs, but all had relatively the same outfit on. 

I put on my best smile as always and waved to them. 

They looked at one another, grunted, and turned back in my direction.

I told them that they were free to look around at what I had to offer them today 

They look intently at the Magic Gem.
“We’d love to take that Magic Gem off your hands”

*[Don’t Sell] 
    "Sorry, this item seems to be reserved for another customer, I hope there’s another item you have in mind on buying here today!" 

    They didn’t seem so keen on my answer. Their main man in the front slammed their palm onto my stand and I jumped. 

    “Look, there’s nothing in our immediate interest besides that. So could you tell us the price of it?” they asked.

    I shook my head in disagreement. All of them grew impatient, did they need the item this badly? I asked again if there was another item they wanted from my shop.

    “NO.” their leader shouted, drawing out a small dagger from their side pocket. The rest of their gang started to do the same. 

    “If you won’t sell us this, perhaps we can take something of equal value. Everyone?”

    I gasped as they started to jump over and into my shop, ransacking every corner for the gold I kept. I didn’t have the guts to fight them off but held tightly onto what they so desired. It took them only a few minutes until my place was robbed of the gold I worked really hard to earn.

*[Haggle]
    “Earnings have been a little low as of late, are you willing to pay a little more for this item?” I asked.

    The bandits look at each other once more, muttering amongst themselves and turn back to me. Their main man came up, slammed his palm upon my stand, and stared dead into my eyes. 

    I glanced at the Gem they wanted and back at them. 

    “How about 120 gold?” 

    I looked over at my other items, that was only 20 more than my highest priced item.
    
**[Take it]
    ->Taken
    
**[Higher] 
    I shook my head, asking for a higher price. I started to propose the idea of 250. 

    They weren't thrilled at that price, asking for 150. 
    
***[Take it Higher] 
    I shook my head once more. That wasn't enough for me. I asked for 240, lowering for side of the offer by only a bit so I would still earn a larger amount. 

    The group started to get antsy, their leader starting to ask for 175
***[Take it]
    ->Taken
    
****[Ask for a higher price still]
    --I shook my head a third time, firmly stating my offer to be at 230 and that was final. 
    
    My stance didn't sit well and I heard all of them scowl. The sounds of weapons drawing screeched through my ear, and suddenly they started to jump over my into my shop. I covered my face with my arms in defense incase they tried to attack me. I heard them yelling, rustling through my item stash and eventually jumping back outside, their footsteps fading as distance grew. 

    I opened my eyes to see that 2 antidotes and the Staff of Ice was stolen from me. I sighed in disappointment. I dusted myself off and started to rearrange my items. So much for haggling

===Taken===
  I shook my head in agreement and slight disappointment that I took a lower price than expected. I then asked for the gold they now owed me.

    Their main man went through his pockets, which seemed to take a while for some reason. Suddenly, a weapon was drawn instead pointing at my face. It was a trap! 

    I jumped back in defense, covering my face in fear as the group jumped over into my shop, rummaging through the many items I held. They went through it for quite some time, their footsteps now being heard jumping back outside and running away. I opened my eyes to see that the Scroll of Binding was stolen! Those rats! I sighed heavily, dusting myself off and started to rearrange all my items, hoping that the next customer won't rob me of my items.
