{
- Gold > 1000: Wow. Business has been pretty good today. There’s a good few interesting characters in town too. For someone like me that’s fine. The more pockets full of clanking metal the better. I imagine to the right person though, these people could be trouble.

=Encounter1
I spot a cloaked figure approaching the stand from my peripherals. I welcome them like I would anyone else.

"Hi! What can I do for you today?"

They respond with a dialect and awkward tone.

“Uhhhh hi. I was wondering if you had any hero kil- I mean weapons. YES. WEAAPONS."

They tried to cover up that first response with another. Not that it makes any difference. I hear those words dishearteningly often.

"…Yeah. I got a few. What are you looking for?"

“Anything powerful.”

"Uhhhh I’m not too savvy on how effective these all are but…"

I take out every sharp and magic-looking thing from under the counter beside me.

"I came across all of these for a pretty hefty price. If you can’t match or offer something better then Your luck doesn’t lie with me."

“Oh yes that’s totally fine! Totally fine! A Okay!!”

"Hey you feeling okay? It is pretty hot today. I have some antidotes in the back. It’ll look bad on me if you faint in front of my stall in front of a counter full of magic artifacts."

“Uhhhhh….”

=Antidote
The masked figure sweats profusely. As they sweat, the mask begins to slide off their face

"Okay that settles it. You’re freaking me out. Just take an antidote."

I dash to the back and grab an antidote from my stock and bring it back out to the counter. I see the customer quickly moving their hand away from the counter. It’s obvious what they were trying to do, but I play it cool.

"Here you go."

I extend my grasped hand towards theirs.

“OH! Th-thank you.”

They carefully slip the patch between their lips without removing their mask more than a centimeter from their face.

"Okay. How do you feel now?"

“Oh great. Just fantastic!... Actually, I’m feeling a LOT better. I Never expected this to work so well.”

Hearing this brings me relief.

"Perfect. Are you ready to actually do business?"

“Oh of course! Now let’s see here. A dagger of fire, wielded by my- various orcs throughout this region; a staff of ice… These take me back! You’re a merchant with a fine eye to have all of these!”

"Bro these literally just fall in my lap. I don’t even know which end to hold some of these."

“Bah! You have a good selection, sure. But I need something a bit bigger than this.”

I swear if they don’t buy anything after I gave them the antidote…

"Bigger how? Remember I don’t even know if I showed you all my weapons. I could be carrying a mountain-leveling frog and I wouldn’t know about it."

“Oh those ones are the worst! But you can’t train them so they’re useless in battle! But yes, bring out anything that looks even slightly magic to you.”
…

“I promise I have the coin!”

They hold out a cow’s stomach full of jingling silver goodness.

"Done."

I go into the back to find what I can.

=Crystal
I grab the supposedly magic crystal and bring it to the counter.

"Alright I got you a… Gem of caramel? I don’t know what this is. I said before that some of this stuff fell into my lap but this one literally did. A wizard decided this was a fair trade so I guess it's worth someth-"

They hastily drop the bag of coins on the counter

“I’ll take it.”

"Alright! Deal!"

Without saying another word the figure grabs the crystal and heads out. 

"Strange… they suddenly gained a lot of confidence once I treated them. They often say some people just have colder blood than the rest of us. Heh, kinda like Mr. big bad out East. I wonder what- Oh my god that was Drekalynch Crawforanic."

Welp, he just made me rich! Not much else I can do."

=Scroll
I grab one of the more torn-up scrolls from the shelf and show it to the figure.

"Here. I got this. It’s a binding scroll, but I’m not sure how to activate it, I’m pretty sure you say the words like this: Crawvinch…? No. Crevalgggick!"

“Please stop. You embarrass yourself. I’ll just take that.”

They reach out and quickly but gently grab the scroll from my hands. This surprises me more than irks me.

"Wow. You seem to be experienced."

“This is a particularly strong binding scroll. The dialect is old, so not many people can read it aloud, or procure a counter-spell for it. I’m surprised you had something like this. Would you be willing to part with it for say, 120?”

"Wow that’s double what I was going to charge you! You got yourself a deal."

We shook hands on it and the headed on their way. I’m not entirely sure, but I think I sensed a smile under that mask. I just hope it wasn’t a shit-eating grin…

->MainLoop

=Forward
I weigh my options and decide this guy isn't worth the trouble. 

"Look pal, I have a business to run, and I don’t need you scaring away all my customers."

“Oh… oh I see. I’m sorry. -pant- I’ll just go sit in the shade for a bit, maybe try a different shop…”

"Alright. You take care now."

They wobble out of my sight. I wonder what their del was, not that it matters to me.
